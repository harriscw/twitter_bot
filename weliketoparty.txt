"We Like To Party!"
by The Vengaboys
[Intro:]
We like to party
We like, we like to party
[Repeat 3X]
I've got something to tell ya
I've got news for you
Gonna put some wheels in motion
Get ready 'cause we're coming through
[Chorus:]
Hey now, hey now, hear what I say now (1)
Happiness is just around the corner
Hey now, hey now, hear what I say now (2)
We'll be there for you
The Vengabus is coming
And everybody's jumping
New York to San Fransisco
An intercity disco
The wheels of steel are turning
And traffic lights are burning
So if you like to party
Get on and move your body
[Repeat Intro]
[Repeat Chorus]
The Vengabus is coming, the Vengabus is coming
The Vengabus is coming, the Vengabus is..
[Repeat Chorus again]
